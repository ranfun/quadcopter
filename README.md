# quadcopter
A quadcopter or quadrotor is a type of helicopter with four rotors. 
Each rotor produces both lift and torque about its center of rotation, as well as drag opposite to the vehicle's direction of flight.
Quadcopters generally have two rotors spinning clockwise (CW) and two counterclockwise (CCW). 
Flight control is provided by independent variation of the speed and hence lift and torque of each rotor. 
Pitch and roll are controlled by varying the net centre of thrust, with yaw controlled by varying the net torque.
